# Python Chatbot

## Set up
- Install pip modules
- run `python main.py` (windows) `python3 main.py` (everything else)
- Use the discord bot to train the model
- Use the discord bot to test the model

## Debugging
I made this entire thing in an hour like a year ago  
If anything breaks try to fix it yourself
